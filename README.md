main branch: Contains original files for FreeNOS

master branch: Contains original files for FreeNOS

priority branch: Contains additional priority scheduling and renice implementation in FreeNOS

Demo of the priority schedulding and renice command. Utilized smaller sc processes for a shorter running time to demonstrate the functionality easier in the demo.
